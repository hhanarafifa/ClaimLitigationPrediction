# Claim Litigation Prediction

Dataset consists of 1340 bodily injury liability claim from a single US state using a 2002 survey conducted by the Insurance Research Council (IRC). The survey is conducted in order to understand the characteristics of the claimants who choose to be represented by an Attorney when settling a claim. The profits of an Insurance firm are often found to be dependent on whether the claimant appoints an Attorney or not -- appointment of an atterney can often increase the amount the claimant can calim from the firm.

An Insurance firm may be interested in finding the probability of a claimant appointing an Attorney. Depending on the demographic characteristics of the claimants who appoint an Atterney, the firm aims to design different policy instruments for different target groups.

- Goal: Build and test a logistic regression model to predict whether a claimant would appoint an attorney
